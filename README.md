### Hello!

I am a software engineer. As a programmer, I use 99% Java at work. In my free time
I like to dabble in other languages. I prefer:

- Java, because that's what I know best.
- Lua (+ Love2D) for game programming.
- Go, because it's fairly easy, fast, and type safe.
- C, because it's also relatively easy. I wanted to learn it to understand more
  about memory management, Linux kernel programming and so on. I believe that
  understanding C will make you a better programmer.

Learning Rust more thorougly is also on my TODO list.

I've also attempted to do things in C++, but it's quite comprehensive. I decided
it's not worth it anymore (in my free time), because there is just too much to
know, and life is too short :)
